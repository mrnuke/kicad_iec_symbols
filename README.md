# IEC symbols for 7400 series logic ICs

A KiCAD symbol library for 7400 series logic ICs in IEC flavor.

## Mission

The mission of this library is to provide a complete set of IEC logic symbols
for 7400 series ICs which are still available today. This is to include 4000
series ICs, since a majority of them come under some sort of 74xx flavor.

## Status

TODO.

### Power pin handling

The symbols are built manually and the power pins are included as explicit pins.
It would be nice to have a set of scripts to create additional sets of symbols:

1. Symbol set with hidden power pins
2. Symbol set with separate unit for power pins
